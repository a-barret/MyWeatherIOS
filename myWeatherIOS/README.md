# Overview

This application allows the user to enter a city name and the program will fetch weather data from an online API called openweathermap.org. The user can select between Celsius or Fahrenheit and those related units of measurement.

I created this app to understand better how to build mobile applications for iOS and also to increase my understanding of APIs.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

To build this application, I used Xcode as my IDE. I used an iPhone simulator to test my application.

I use the swift language coupled with the SwiftUI framework to write the code for the mobile application.

# Future Work

* I want to make it possible to have multiple cities listed  with their weather at once.
* I want to add the ability to collect GPS data to display local weather data by default.
* Fix issues with screen displaying as the title whatever you write in the text field, rather than the city weather data that is actually being displayed.
* I'd like to add a map eventually that display weather conditions based on visual data.
